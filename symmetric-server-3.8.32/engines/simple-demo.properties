# Staging Area - symmetricDS creates temporary extraction and data load files with the CSV payload of a synchronization when the value of the 
# stream.to.file.threshold.bytes SymmetricDS property has been reached. Before reaching the threshold, files are streamed to/from memory. 
# The default threshold value is 32,767 bytes. This feature may be turned off by setting the stream.to.file.enabled property to false.
# SymmetricDS creates these temporary files in the directory specified by the java.io.tmpdir Java System property --> cd /tmp/mashr-moffett/
